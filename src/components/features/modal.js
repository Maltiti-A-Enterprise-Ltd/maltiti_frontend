          <h1>Rabiatu Abukari</h1>
          Founder and CEO Rabiatu Gurunpaga Abukari started Maltiti A. Enterprise Limited as a very
          small business two decades ago. Rabiatu is an inspiring woman. She makes sure that over
          5000 women produce good quality products, she trains them, and she is on a mission of
          mechanizing the manual processes.
          <br /> Because of her commitment the women earn more and the level of education and
          prosperity increases. In addition, Rabiatu helps the women with mobile savings as well as
          health insurance. The growth of the company creates new communities, allowing more women
          to work. Part of the proceeds are used to send children to school. <br />
          Rabiatu: “We’re at a major turning point with Maltiti. In recent years we have worked hard
          to get the production of shea butter and black soap off the ground. Thanks to the efforts
          of hundreds of strong Ghanaian women we have succeeded. In the coming years, we want to
          continue to build on the quality of our products. In the first instance, we will focus on
          our home market in Ghana. Of course, we also want to play an increasing role in the
          international markets in the long term.”
