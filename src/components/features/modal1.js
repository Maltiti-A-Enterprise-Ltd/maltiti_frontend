            <p>
              Founder and CEO Rabiatu Gurunpaga Abukari started Maltiti A. Enterprise Limited as a
              very small business two decades ago. Rabiatu is an inspiring woman. She makes sure
              that over 5000 women produce good quality products, she trains them, and she is on a
              mission of mechanizing the manual processes.
              <br /> Because of her commitment the women earn more and the level of education and
              prosperity increases. In addition, Rabiatu helps the women with mobile savings as well
              as health insurance. The growth of the company creates new communities, allowing more
              women to work. Part of the proceeds are used to send children to school. <br />
              Rabiatu: “We’re at a major turning point with Maltiti. In recent years we have worked
              hard to get the production of shea butter and black soap off the ground. Thanks to the
              efforts of hundreds of strong Ghanaian women we have succeeded. In the coming years,
              we want to continue to build on the quality of our products. In the first instance, we
              will focus on our home market in Ghana. Of course, we also want to play an increasing
              role in the international markets in the long term.”
