          <p>
            Founder and CEO Rabiatu Gurunpaga Abukari started Maltiti A.
            Enterprise Limited as a very small business two decades ago. Rabiatu
            is an inspiring woman. She makes sure that over 5000 women produce
            good quality products, she trains them, and she is on a mission of
            mechanizing the manual processes.
            <br /> Because of her commitment the women earn more and the level
            of education and prosperity increases. In addition, Rabiatu helps
            the women with mobile savings as well as health insurance. The
            growth of the company creates new communities, allowing more women
            to work. Part of the proceeds are used to send children to school.{" "}
            <br />
            Rabiatu: “We’re at a major turning point with Maltiti. In recent
            years we have worked hard to get the production of shea butter and
            black soap off the ground. Thanks to the efforts of hundreds of
            strong Ghanaian women we have succeeded. In the coming years, we
            want to continue to build on the quality of our products. In the
            first instance, we will focus on our home market in Ghana. Of
            course, we also want to play an increasing role in the international
            markets in the long term.”
